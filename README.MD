# What is IR-with-Alexa ?
I will walk you through the process of creating an automation around doing basic Incident Response in AWS with the help of Alexa. Let's say, you have your own Ec2 instance running in AWS which is hosting your website, and one day you found it is down due to some reason (may be an attack?!), so you just need to instruct Your Alexa Device (Echo Dot, or anything else you have with you) to revibe your server, and she will do the job for you.
* If you successfully deployed the project, kudos to you!! In return get me some subscribers for my YouTube ChannelðŸ‘‰ https://www.youtube.com/c/BlackPerl
* If you like to support my creation and pay me back a little, you can buy me a coffee â˜• https://www.buymeacoffee.com/BlackPerl

# Setup
You will need the following to get started:
* Alexa Developer Account, if you don't have, create one here ðŸ‘‰ https://developer.amazon.com
* Some AWS Knowledge such as basic navigation around console, launching EC2 instances, basic knowledge of Lambda, IAM roles etc. And you are ready to roll!
* There may be some region limitations so for this project I worked out of â€˜us-west-2â€™ region aka Oregon for the Lambda part.
